# ‚ú® Intelligent Threat Hunting in Multi-Cloud Environments using Graph Neural Networks

Welcome to the project repository for **Intelligent Threat Hunting in Multi-Cloud Environments using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**.  
This project is a blueprint for a next-generation security platform designed to tackle the most formidable challenges of modern multi-cloud infrastructure.  

By transforming fragmented security data into a unified, interconnected **"cyber graph"**, we apply the power of GNNs to detect, predict, and visualize sophisticated cyberattacks that would otherwise remain invisible to traditional security tools.

## üí° The Problem: An Invisible Attack Surface

The widespread adoption of multi-cloud strategies across providers like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud** offers immense flexibility but creates a fragmented and complex security landscape. Traditional **SIEM** systems struggle with:

- **Fragmented Visibility**: A lack of a single, coherent view across disparate cloud platforms creates significant blind spots.  
- **Siloed Alerts**: Alerts from each cloud's native tools are isolated, making it impossible to see a complete, multi-stage attack narrative.  
- **Alert Fatigue**: The sheer volume and noise of alerts overwhelm security teams, burying genuine threats.  
- **Missed "Low and Slow" Attacks**: Rule-based systems often fail to detect sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that unfold over time and traverse multiple environments.  

üëâ Our project addresses these critical shortcomings head-on.

## üöÄ The Solution: A Paradigm Shift to Relationship-Based Security

We propose a radical shift from isolated alert analysis to a **holistic, graph-based security model**.  
Our solution is built on three core pillars:

### 1. Unified Multi-Cloud Data & Graph Representation
- **Nodes (Entities):** VMs, containers, users, IAM roles, IPs, API calls, logins, and external threat intel.  
- **Edges (Relationships):** Connections (e.g., `communicates_with`, `assumes_role`, `accessed`, `triggered_alert`).  
- **Graph Database:** High-performance storage (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) for fast traversal & complex queries.

### 2. The Power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- **Detect Complex Attack Paths:** Identify multi-hop, cross-cloud attack chains.  
- **Proactive Anomaly Detection:** Learn ‚Äúnormal‚Äù behavior and flag deviations‚Äîeven unseen (zero-day) threats.  
- **Predict Future Threats:** Highlight weak links and vulnerable assets to strengthen defenses.  

### 3. Actionable Insights & Visualization
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A single pane of glass for security posture across clouds.  
- **Attack Path Visualization:** Full reconstruction of attack chains with timestamps & involved resources.  
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Transparent reasoning behind GNN detections to accelerate incident response.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture & Implementation Phases

### 1. Multi-Cloud Data Ingestion & Normalization
- **Sources:** AWS CloudTrail, Azure AD, GCP Audit Logs, VPC Flow Logs, and native security services.  
- **Normalization:** Convert heterogeneous logs into a **Unified Data Model (UDM)**.  

### 2. Graph Construction
- **Schema:** Defines blueprint for nodes & edges.  
- **Database:** Scalable graph database for real-time analysis.  

### 3. GNN Model Development
- **Architecture:** Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) to handle heterogeneous data.  
- **Training:** Semi-supervised or unsupervised anomaly detection without relying on signatures.  

### 4. Inference & Visualization
- **Pipeline:** Real-time graph analysis using trained GNNs.  
- **Dashboard:** Intuitive web-based visualization for analysts.
